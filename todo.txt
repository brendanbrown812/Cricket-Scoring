Additions needed:

-When creating a new game, need the option for teams - dropdown for "Players per team"
 -> Somehow need to be able to change who's on each team. Should be better than being forced into whatever order the players are selected in.

-Might need to get rid of the header when in a game. Currently need to scroll to see all point options.

-Miss button and exit game button should not look similar and be next to each other.

-"Bullseye" is cutoff on the button

-Should have markins within each scoring box, thinking roman numerals

-Need the ability to resume games if you've quit out of them.

-Having profile pictures per person would be sick. Not a big deal if not an option

-History page should have the ability to select a player and see their stats only instead of scrolling through stats for all players.

-Need an "undo" button when in a game.
